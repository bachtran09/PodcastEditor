# VPAutomation
A Python program that automatically edits a podcast or conversation between two people based on who is louder.

Requirements: 
Python 3+: https://www.python.org/downloads/

SciPy: https://scipy.org/install/

MoviePy: https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/install.html

Before editing:
You will need two video files, one with the camera and audio feed for each speaker.

Each file needs to start at the same place so that they can be combined later on.

The audios of the two files should already be mixed to equivalent volume levels.

How to use:
Go into the terminal and cd to the directory where VPAutomation.py is located and run it with "py VPAutomation.py"

Input the directory of each video file, then enter the name you want for the edited file (no file extension is necessary).
